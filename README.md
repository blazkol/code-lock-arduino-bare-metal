Embedded project created using the Arduino Uno. The project used C and the AVR libraries instead of the Arduino framework.

## Description
The user can enter a four-character password with the use of a numerical keypad. Each time a character is entered, it is displayed on the LCD screen. After entering all 4 characters, the LCD screen will display information that the password is correct. The green LED will light up if the password is correct and the red LED will light up if the password is incorrect. After a few seconds, the user may try to enter the password again. The correct password is predefined in the program code.
